**RGBD-SOD Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the search and rescue (SAR) industry. 

The dataset consists of 38943 images with 34352 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*salient object*).

Images in the RGBD-SOD dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 4591 (12% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (22893 images) and *train* (16050 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***im_id*** and ***subfolder*** tags. The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, United Arab Emirates</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Nankai University, China</span>.
